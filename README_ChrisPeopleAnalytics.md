# Chris's People Analytics AI Dashboard

## üöÄ Overview
This project is a full-stack, cost-effective AI-powered People Analytics Dashboard built for end-users like Chris to explore and gain insights from LinkedIn data using natural language prompts.

Using PhantomBuster for data extraction, Power BI for data visualization, and an embedded chatbot powered by OpenRouter + GPT (OpenAI-compatible), this solution allows a non-technical user to:
- View a live dashboard
- Ask questions using plain English
- Get insights without touching any code

This project is also a tribute to **Chris Broderick**, a highly respected board member of the People Analytics community in Chicago. After her final event on May 20 in Chicago and her transition to Texas, this dashboard honors her invaluable contributions by showcasing the vibrant community she helped shape.
